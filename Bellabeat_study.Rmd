## Case Study on Fitbit Dataset 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

The Google Data Analytics Certificate offers two options to choose the guided capstone project from.
This is a demonstration of the second option - Bellabeat Smart Device Case Study.

We will install the required libraries first. Primarily, 'readr' is used for 'read_csv', 'tidyverse', for visualization, 'skimr' for operators like pipe, etc. and others' use will be demonstrated soon.

```{r,warning=FALSE}
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggpubr)
library(here)
library(skimr)
library(janitor)
library(lubridate)
library(ggrepel)
options(readr.show_col_types = FALSE) #this is to mute column specifications using 'readr'
hourlySteps_merged <- read_csv('hourlySteps_merged.csv')
summary(hourlySteps_merged) #statistical review of the dataset.

```

```{r}
dailyActivity_merged <- read_csv('dailyActivity_merged.csv')
summary(dailyActivity_merged)
```

```{r} 
sleepDay_merged <- read_csv('sleepDay_merged.csv')
summary(sleepDay_merged)
```

We will be using these 3 datasets for the analysis.

### Cleaning

We will first look for inconsistencies:

```{r}
sum(duplicated(dailyActivity_merged))
sum(duplicated(hourlySteps_merged))
sum(duplicated(sleepDay_merged))
```
We can see that there are 3 duplicated entries in the 'sleepday' dataset.
We will remove these and retain the unique rows.

```{r}
sleepDay_merged <- sleepDay_merged %>% distinct() %>% drop_na()
sum(duplicated(sleepDay_merged))
```

```{r}
clean_names(dailyActivity_merged)

```

We can see that the names are now consistent with underscores and naming standard. We will repeat the same for the other datasets and change the column names to lowercase.


```{r}
dailyActivity_merged <- rename_with(dailyActivity_merged,tolower)
clean_names(sleepDay_merged)
sleepDay_merged <- rename_with(sleepDay_merged,tolower)
clean_names(hourlySteps_merged)
hourlySteps_merged <- rename_with(hourlySteps_merged,tolower)
show(dailyActivity_merged)
```
As we will be merging 'daily_activity' and ' sleep' datasets, we will change datetime format in 'sleep' dataset to date format.

```{r,warning=FALSE}
dailyActivity_merged <- dailyActivity_merged %>% rename(date=activitydate) %>% mutate(date = as_date(date, format = '%m/%d/%Y'))
sleepDay_merged <- sleepDay_merged %>% rename(date=sleepday) %>% mutate(date = as_date(date,format = '%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p',tz = Sys.timezone()))
```

Let's check the format:

```{r}
head(dailyActivity_merged)
head(sleepDay_merged)
```
We will need the date format of 'activity_hour' column of the 'hourly_steps' dataset to be in datetime format for visualization. For that, we will use the 'as.POSIXct' function, while we used 'as_date' function for the other two datasets.


```{r}
hourlySteps_merged <- hourlySteps_merged %>% rename(date_time = activityhour) %>% mutate(date_time = as.POSIXct(date_time,format= '%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p',tz = Sys.timezone()))
```

Let's check the dataset:

```{r}
head(hourlySteps_merged)
```

Let's merge 'dailyactivity' and 'sleepday' as 'id' and 'date' as primary keys.

```{r}
daily_activity_sleep <- merge(dailyActivity_merged,sleepDay_merged,by=c('id','date'))
head(daily_activity_sleep)
```

### Analyzing Phase

Let's start analyzing and trying to draw conclusions now.


We will first try to analyze the 'step' activity level for different type of users, based on how active they are at walking.

```{r}
daily_user_avg <- daily_activity_sleep %>% group_by(id) %>% summarize(mean_daily_steps=mean(totalsteps))
```

Let's view the tibble.

```{r}
head(daily_user_avg)
```

Let's add a new column classifying these users based on how active they are:

```{r}
user_type <- daily_user_avg %>% mutate(user_type = case_when(
  mean_daily_steps < 5000 ~ 'sedentary',
  mean_daily_steps >= 5000 & mean_daily_steps < 7500 ~ 'lightly active',
  mean_daily_steps >= 7500 & mean_daily_steps < 10000 ~ 'moderately active',
  mean_daily_steps >= 10000 ~ 'highly active'
))
```

Let's view the tibble:

```{r}
head(user_type)
```

Now, we will make a tibble to demonstrate the percentage out of the total for each step user type.

```{r}
user_type_percent <- user_type %>%
  group_by(user_type) %>%
  summarise(total = n()) %>%
  mutate(totals = sum(total)) %>%
  group_by(user_type) %>%
  summarise(total_percent = total / totals) %>%
  mutate(labels = scales::percent(total_percent))
head(user_type_percent)
```

Let's sew this into a pie chart:

```{r}
user_type_percent %>%
  ggplot(aes(x="",y=total_percent, fill=user_type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 1)+
  coord_polar("y", start=0)+
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(axis.title.x= element_blank(),
        axis.title.y = element_blank(),
        panel.border = element_blank(), 
        panel.grid = element_blank(), 
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size=14, face = "bold")) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#ffd490","#e6e600", "#85e085", "#ff8080")) +
  geom_text(aes(label = labels),
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5))+
  labs(title="User type distribution")
```

#### We find that 38% of the users are moderately active walkers, all other types at 21%.


Now, we will group our findings based on each day of the week, i.e., depending on the day, how active the users are and how much sleep users have got in.

```{r}
weekdays_steps_sleep <- daily_activity_sleep %>% mutate(weekday = weekdays(date))
weekdays_steps_sleep$weekday <- ordered(weekdays_steps_sleep$weekday,levels = c('Monday','Tuesday','Wednesday','Thursday','Friday','Saturday','Sunday'))

weekdays_steps_sleep <- weekdays_steps_sleep %>% group_by(weekday) %>% summarize(steps = mean(totalsteps), sleep = mean(totalminutesasleep))
```

Let's look at a tibble of the result:

```{r}
head(weekdays_steps_sleep)
```

```{r}
ggarrange(
    ggplot(weekdays_steps_sleep) +
      geom_col(aes(weekday, steps), fill = "#006699") +
      geom_hline(yintercept = 7500) +
      labs(title = "Daily steps per weekday", x= "", y = "") +
      theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45,vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1)),
    ggplot(weekdays_steps_sleep, aes(weekday, sleep)) +
      geom_col(fill = "#85e0e0") +
      geom_hline(yintercept = 480) +
      labs(title = "Minutes asleep per weekday", x= "", y = "") +
      theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45,vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
  )
```

#### We can see that as users do walk more than 7500 steps daily, they fail to maintain a healthy sleeping time of 8 hours.

We will now try to measure steps taken at each hour of the day by the users. 

```{r}
hourlySteps_merged <- hourlySteps_merged %>%
  separate(date_time, into = c("date", "time"), sep= " ") %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(date)) 

```


Our observations with '00:00:00' have been converted to Null.
We will change that.


```{r}
head(hourlySteps_merged)
```

```{r}
hourlySteps_merged[is.na(hourlySteps_merged)] <- as.character('00:00:00')
```

```{r}
head(hourlySteps_merged)
```
```{r}
hourlySteps_merged%>%
  group_by(time) %>%
  summarize(average_steps = mean(steptotal)) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x=time, y = average_steps, fill = average_steps)) + 
  labs(title = "Hourly steps throughout the day", x="", y="") + 
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "green", high = "red")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
```

#### Users are usually active betweem 8am to 7pm, being most active between 12pm and 2pm, and 5pm and 7pm.



Now, we will check for correlations.

I would assume there to be a correlation between steps and calories burnt, and also between steps and minutes slept(assuming more steps would make a person sleep more because of tiredness.)

```{r}
ggarrange(
ggplot(daily_activity_sleep, aes(x=totalsteps, y=totalminutesasleep))+
  geom_jitter() +
  geom_smooth(color = "red") + 
  labs(title = "Daily steps vs Minutes asleep", x = "Daily steps", y= "Minutes asleep") +
   theme(panel.background = element_blank(),
        plot.title = element_text( size=14)), 
ggplot(daily_activity_sleep, aes(x=totalsteps, y=calories))+
  geom_jitter() +
  geom_smooth(color = "red") + 
  labs(title = "Daily steps vs Calories", x = "Daily steps", y= "Calories") +
   theme(panel.background = element_blank(),
        plot.title = element_text( size=14))
)
```
#### As we can see, the second assumption made regarding sleep and steps was proven to be untrue.
#### However, with respect to basic biology, we can verify that the more steps walked, the more are the calories burnt.


Lastly, we will analyze the time spent by users actually using the smart device.


```{r}
daily_use1 <- daily_activity_sleep %>%
  group_by(id) %>%
  summarize(days_used=n()) %>%
  mutate(usage = case_when(
    days_used >= 1 & days_used <= 10 ~ "low use",
    days_used >= 11 & days_used <= 20 ~ "moderate use", 
    days_used >= 21 & days_used <= 31 ~ "high use", 
  ))
  
head(daily_use1)
```


```{r}
daily_use_percent1 <- daily_use1 %>%
  group_by(usage) %>%
  summarise(total = n()) %>%
  mutate(totals = sum(total)) %>%
  group_by(usage) %>%
  summarise(total_percent = total / totals) %>%
  mutate(labels = scales::percent(total_percent))

daily_use_percent1$usage <- factor(daily_use_percent1$usage, levels = c("high use", "moderate use", "low use"))

head(daily_use_percent1)
```

```{r}
daily_use_percent1 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x="",y=total_percent, fill=usage)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 1)+
  coord_polar("y", start=0)+
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(axis.title.x= element_blank(),
        axis.title.y = element_blank(),
        panel.border = element_blank(), 
        panel.grid = element_blank(), 
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size=14, face = "bold")) +
  geom_text(aes(label = labels),
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5))+
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#006633","#00e673","#80ffbf"),
                    labels = c("High use - 21 to 31 days",
                                 "Moderate use - 11 to 20 days",
                                 "Low use - 1 to 10 days"))+
  labs(title="Daily use of smart device")
```


#### We can see that 50% of the users use the smart device actively, which seems to be a very reinforcement.



### Based on the conclusions drawn by these visualizations, we find that:
###  1)Users of our dataset are moderately active walkers, measuring at nearly 40% of the user sample.
###  2)As our users in the sample appear to be daily walkers, they fail to maintain healthy sleeping habits.
###  3)Most of the physical activity is done in the mid-daytime, specifically between 12 and 2 in the afternoon and 5 and 7 in the evening.
###  4)An assumption of ours, where more steps could correlate to more sleep, was proven wrong and the notion of more steps and calories burnt was reinstated.
###  5)We found out that most of the users iin our sample actively use the smart device(about 50% of the sample).
